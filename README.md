## Golang
This is a repository of miscellaneous apps I am developing using the Go programming language (otherwise known as "Golang"). This README.md file will also serve as my personal Golang cheat-sheet. 

**How to Install Go on a Debian Linux-based System**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install golang -y
```

**If/Else Statement**
```go
package main
import "fmt"
func main() {
    if 1 + 1 == 2 {
        fmt.Println("True")
    } else {
        fmt.Println("False")
    }
}
```
